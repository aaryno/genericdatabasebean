# GenericDatabaseBean

I wrote this in textpad in October, 2003 with Matt Rahr. Wrote it straight from beginning to end and then tried to compile and run it. I think we had over 100 compile errors the first time we tried this. We just used it to make a generic bean representation of a row in various Oracle tables we had in our database. Looking back years later we realized we had made this O/R mapper at a time when Hibernate was still very young. We probably should have used Hibernate if we had known about it but this did the trick and now serves as a personal piece of history. At the time I had been doing Java on and off for just a few years but had never used an IDE.
