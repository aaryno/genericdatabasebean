# GenericDatabaseBean

I wrote this in textpad in October, 2003 with Matt Rahr. We just used it to make a generic bean representation of a rows in various Oracle tables we had in our database. Looking back years later we realized we had made this O/R mapper at a time when Hibernate was still very young. We probably should have used Hibernate if we had known about it but this did the trick and now serves as a personal piece of history. At the time I had been doing Java on and off for just a few years but had never used an IDE. This utilizes database relations to populate one-to-many relationships in Lists in the root bean.
